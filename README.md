# ROOT.Shared.Utils
Shared utilities for ROOT projects

[![.NET CI Build](https://github.com/bjornbouetsmith/ROOT.Shared.Utils/actions/workflows/dotnet-ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bjornbouetsmith/ROOT.Shared.Utils/actions/workflows/dotnet-ci-build.yml)

The goal of this project is to contain helper functions that can be used by more than one solution.

Primarily to support any other solutions in the ROOT namespace.

## NOTE

Nuget packages found here on github is to be considered development versions and is only meant to enable ci/cd within the ROOT projects.

Packages not found on nuget.org should not be used in production code unless you are ready to change stuff if interfaces or something changes.

Its fine to take packages from here to test out patches etc, but do not expect stable interfaces on new features until its released on nuget.org.
